2. REPORT DETAILS

PLCK-58#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	cmos1_pclk_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in cmos1_pclk_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to K13
	cmos1_pclk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) cannot be placed

Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal cmos1_pclk has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>
